# Budget Tracker Starter Code

During the Budget Tracker challenge, I had the opportunity to learn about PWA's and how they function. I learned how I can built a website that looks and acts like a mobile app with native features. During this challenge I had reach out to some peers for clarification and class time was able to help me understand the concepts better. I was able to create html, javascript, and json to create my application. programs are becoming more familiar as time goes on and the practice we're given is also helping. 


## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
